# Aerodynamics CFD – Harpoon External Store Analysis

This repository contains a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study of an external-store (AGM-84 Harpoon–like) geometry conducted as part of the **Aerodynamics II** final project.

The study investigates the aerodynamic characteristics of the external-store configuration under both **compressible and incompressible viscous flow assumptions**.
